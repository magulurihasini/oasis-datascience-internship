# Iris Flower Classification 

This project is part of the **AICTE Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship**.
The objective of this task is to build a machine learning model that can
classify iris flowers into different species based on their measurements.

## Problem Statement
The Iris dataset contains measurements of iris flowers belonging to three
species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Using these measurements, a machine learning model is trained to predict
the species of an iris flower.

##  Dataset
The Iris dataset includes the following features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The dataset is loaded using the **Scikit-learn library**.

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Machine Learning Model
- Algorithm Used: **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- Data was split into training and testing sets
- Model performance was evaluated using accuracy score and classification report

## Results
The trained model achieved high accuracy in classifying iris flower species
based on the given measurements.

##  Conclusion
This project demonstrates a simple and effective application of machine
learning for classification problems using the Iris dataset.
